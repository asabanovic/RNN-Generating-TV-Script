## Project Overview

This is my RNN project of text generation in the Deep Learning Udacity Course.

The project is utilizing:

1. Embeddings - to generate embeddings of unique words 
2. LSTM - Long Short Term Memory layer
3. Fully Connected layer

### Data

You can find the training data in the `/data` folder so it should be easy to have a quick start with the project
